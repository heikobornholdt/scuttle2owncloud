scuttle2owncloud
======
Converts [scuttle](http://sourceforge.net/projects/scuttle/ "scuttle on sourceforge") entries to owncloud bookmarking app.
Scuttle is not really activly maintained, plus I thought it might be nice to have everything at one place.

## Known bugs/issues
* tags don't work(it's in the code though, i have no idea why owncloud doesn't show them)
* only MySQL (sqlite planned)
